# Legacy Backend Folder (Do Not Use)

This folder is kept for historical reference only.

- Do not run this folder for local development.
- Do not target this folder for tests or deployment.
- Active runtime services are:
  - API: `apps/api`
  - Worker: `apps/worker`
  - Compose: `infra/docker-compose.yml`

If you need to start the backend stack, always use the `apps/*` services.
